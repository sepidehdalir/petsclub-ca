/**
 * The public 4-to-6-month stage.
 *
 * Renders the universal content with **no context**: no breed, no province, no
 * season. That is what makes it a safely indexable page — its content is the
 * same for every reader and does not vary by query string, so there is exactly
 * one canonical version of it. The personalised layers live at `/my-puppy`,
 * which is `noindex` and canonicals here.
 *
 * One page covers three months because two differentiation gates said so
 * independently: nothing separates months four and five, and a standalone
 * six-month page would have repeated roughly two thirds of this one. The
 * reader is still told their exact age — four, five or six months — because a
 * range label is never used as an age claim. See `journeyHeadlineAge`.
 *
 * The former `/puppy/4-5-months` path redirects here permanently, the same way
 * `/puppy/11-weeks` does — see `redirects()` in `next.config.ts`.

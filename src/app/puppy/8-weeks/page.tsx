/**
 * The public 8-week stage.
 *
 * Renders the universal content with **no context**: no breed, no province, no
 * season. That is what makes it a safely indexable page — its content is the
 * same for every reader and does not vary by query string, so there is exactly
 * one canonical version of it. The personalised layers live at `/my-puppy`,
 * which is `noindex` and canonicals here.
 *
 * The framing constraint for this stage is that it must not assume the reader
 * brought a puppy home today. Most puppies arrive around eight weeks; plenty
 * do not, and a rescue puppy may have an estimated birthday. The page is
 * written around the age rather than around a moving day.

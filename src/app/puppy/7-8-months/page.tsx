/**
 * The public 7-to-8-month stage — adolescence.
 *
 * Renders the universal content with **no context**: no breed, no province, no
 * season. That is what makes it a safely indexable page — its content is the
 * same for every reader and does not vary by query string, so there is exactly
 * one canonical version of it. The personalised layers live at `/my-puppy`,
 * which is `noindex` and canonicals here.
 *
 * The reader is still told their exact age — seven months or eight — because a
 * range label is never used as an age claim. See `journeyHeadlineAge`.
 *
 * Every developmental claim here is attributed to Asher et al. 2020 and framed
 * as what that study found, in guide dogs, at approximately eight months. This
 * page must never assert that adolescence begins at a particular age for every
 * dog; see the verification register on the stage.
